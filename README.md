# GROUP JAVA PROGRAMMING EXERCISE REPORT

## 1. TOPIC STATEMENT
We developed a Java Swing program to simulate an ATM machine. The program allows users to perform basic ATM functions.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
a. Login: Users enter a 6-digit PIN to log in.<br>
b. View Account Information: Users can view their account details after successful login.<br>
c. Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money with predefined denominations or enter a custom amount, considering certain conditions.<br>
d. Transfer Money: Users can transfer money to another account, following specific conditions.<br>
e. Change PIN: Users can change their PIN by entering the old and new PIN.<br>

## 3. DATABASE DESIGN
The program utilizes a simple database with one table, "cardinformation," to store ATM account details.<br>

## 4. PROGRAM EXECUTION RESULTS
a. Login: Users insert the card, enter the PIN, and receive error messages for incorrect PINs.<br>

## 5. CONCLUSION
We successfully implemented the basic functions of an ATM using Java Swing. The program, with its limited complexity due to being a simulation, was completed within a short time.
